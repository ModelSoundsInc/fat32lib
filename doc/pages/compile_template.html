                        Develop a Hardware Abstraction Layer library using the included dspic_hal as a template.

                    <span>
                        Open compiler\compiler.h and modify it as required by your compiler.
                        Specifically make sure that the fixed with integer data types are defined correctly
                        for your compiler and if your compiler supports struct packing make sure the proper
                        macro is defined as it increases performance and reduces code size significantly. The
                        comments on compiler.h should help you accomplish this.<br /><br />

                    <span>
                        Open fat.h and enable/disable features to suit your needs. The comments on the file
                        should help you accomplish this. Then load all source files as a project on your IDE
                        (a project file is provided for Microchip's MPLAB) or create a makefile for your compiler 
                        and compile as a static library. Be sure that the compiler folder is in your include path.

                        should help you accomplish this. Then load all source files in the smlib folder to a 
                        project on your IDE (a project file is provided for Microchip's MPLAB) or create a makefile 
                        for your compiler and compile as a static library. Be sure that the compiler folder is in

                        should help you accomplish this. Then load all source files in the sdlib folder to a 
                        project on your IDE (a project file is provided for Microchip's MPLAB) or create a makefile 
                        for your compiler and compile as a static library. Be sure that the compiler folder and
                        your HAL project file are in the include search path.

                        Start using Fat32lib (see examples and documentation) on your project and then compile
                        and link with all the Fat32lib libraries making sure that your HAL library and sdlib are the
                        last two libraries linked.
